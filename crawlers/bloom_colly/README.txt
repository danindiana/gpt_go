The file name for this program could be `web_crawler_with_bloom_filter_telemetry.go`. This name clearly indicates the purpose of the program, which is to crawl web pages and use a Bloom filter for efficient link tracking with telemetry.

The program works as follows:

1. It initializes a Bloom filter with a predefined size.
2. It prompts the user to enter the starting URL for the web crawler.
3. It generates a file name based on the current date/time and the initial URL, to store the output of the crawler.
4. It starts the web crawler with a maximum depth of 12 and enables asynchronous network requests.
5. It sets a limit on the maximum parallelism to 12 to control the number of concurrent requests.
6. It waits for all requests to finish using a wait group.
7. It defines a callback function to process each `a` element with an `href` attribute found in the HTML of a web page.
8. It preprocesses the URL to handle variations and checks if the URL is already visited using the Bloom filter.
9. It writes the visited links to both the console and the output file.
10. It logs the telemetry data, including the total number of links processed, the number of unique links encountered, and the estimated false positive rate of the Bloom filter.
11. It writes the telemetry data to the output file.

Certainly! Here's the refactored version of your program with the additional telemetry:

```go
package main

import (
	"bufio"
	"fmt"
	"net/url"
	"os"
	"strings"
	"sync"
	"time"

	"github.com/gocolly/colly"
	"github.com/willf/bloom"
)

const (
	filterSize = 100000 // The size of the Bloom filter
)

func main() {
	// Initialize the Bloom filter
	filter := bloom.New(filterSize, 5)

	// Variables for telemetry
	var linksProcessed, uniqueLinks int

	// Create a new collector
	c := colly.NewCollector(
		colly.MaxDepth(12), // Set the maximum depth to 12
		colly.Async(true),  // Enable asynchronous network requests
	)

	// Limit the maximum parallelism to 12
	c.Limit(&colly.LimitRule{DomainGlob: "*", Parallelism: 12})

	// Create a wait group to wait for all requests to finish
	var wg sync.WaitGroup

	// Read the starting URL from the user
	fmt.Print("Enter the starting URL: ")
	reader := bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin)
	startURL, _ := reader.ReadString('\n')
	startURL = strings.TrimSpace(startURL)
	startURL = preprocessURL(startURL)

	// Generate a file name based on the current system date/time and the initial URL
	fileName := fmt.Sprintf("%s_%s.txt", time.Now().Format("2006-01-02T150405"), urlToFileName(startURL))
	file, err := os.Create(fileName)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error creating file:", err)
		return
	}
	defer file.Close()

	// Start the crawler
	fmt.Printf("Starting crawl at: %s\n", startURL)
	c.Visit(startURL)

	// On every a element which has href attribute call callback
	c.OnHTML("a[href]", func(e *colly.HTMLElement) {
		wg.Add(1) // Increment the wait group counter
		defer wg.Done() // Decrement the wait group counter when the goroutine is done

		link := e.Attr("href")
		// Preprocess the URL to handle variations
		link = preprocessURL(link)
		if link == "" {
			return
		}

		linksProcessed++ // Increment total links processed

		// Check if the URL is already visited
		if !filter.TestAndAdd([]byte(link)) {
			uniqueLinks++ // Increment unique links count
			output := fmt.Sprintf("Visiting: %s\n", link)
			fmt.Print(output)        // Output to console
			file.WriteString(output) // Write the same output to the file
			// Add the link to the collector to be visited
			e.Request.Visit(link)
		}
	})

	// Wait for all requests to finish
	c.Wait()
	wg.Wait()

	// Log the telemetry data
	telemetryOutput := fmt.Sprintf("Crawl finished.\nTotal links processed: %d\nUnique links found: %d\n",
		linksProcessed, uniqueLinks)
	fmt.Print(telemetryOutput)
	file.WriteString(telemetryOutput)
}

// preprocessURL preprocesses the input URL to handle variations
func preprocessURL(inputURL string) string {
	parsedURL, err := url.Parse(inputURL)
	if err != nil {
		return ""
	}

	if parsedURL.Scheme == "" {
		parsedURL.Scheme = "http"
	}

	if parsedURL.Host == "" {
		return ""
	}

	hostname := strings.ToLower(parsedURL.Hostname())
	if strings.HasPrefix(hostname, "www.") {
		hostname = strings.TrimPrefix(hostname, "www.")
	}
	parsedURL.Host = hostname

	return parsedURL.String()
}

// urlToFileName sanitizes the URL to be used in a file name
func urlToFileName(url string) string {
	sanitized := strings.ReplaceAll(url, "http://", "")
	sanitized = strings.ReplaceAll(sanitized, "https://", "")
	sanitized = strings.ReplaceAll(sanitized, "/", "_")
	sanitized = strings.ReplaceAll(sanitized, ":", "_")
	sanitized = strings.ReplaceAll(sanitized, ".", "_")
	return sanitized
}
```

This version of the program includes the same functionality as the previous version, but without the attempt to calculate the false positive rate of the Bloom filter. Instead, it only logs the total number of links processed and the number of unique links encountered. This should still provide useful insights into the efficiency of the crawling process.


that throws the following error when I run it:

 go run web_crawl_bloom_telm.go 
# command-line-arguments
./web_crawl_bloom_telm.go:90:39: filter.EstimatedFalsePositiveRate undefined (type *bloom.BloomFilter has no field or method EstimatedFalsePositiveRate)
ChatGPT
!
It seems there was a mistake in assuming the availability of an EstimatedFalsePositiveRate method on the willf/bloom Bloom filter package. This package does not provide a direct method for estimating the false positive rate after items have been added to the filter. My apologies for the confusion.

To still provide some form of telemetry without the false positive rate calculation, you can focus on the total number of links processed and the number of unique links that were added to the Bloom filter. Although we cannot directly calculate the false positive rate without implementing additional statistical methods, tracking the number of unique links vs. total links can give you insight into the efficiency of your crawling process.

Here's a refactored version of the program that includes the additional telemetry, minus the incorrect reference to EstimatedFalsePositiveRate:
