Here’s a list of **additional modifications** you can make to the code to improve **error handling**, **crawling efficiency**, and **robustness**:

---

### **1. Better Error Handling**
#### a. **Detailed HTTP Error Handling**
   - Add specific handling for common HTTP errors (e.g., `401 Unauthorized`, `500 Internal Server Error`).
   - Log the response body for errors to provide more context.

#### b. **File System Error Handling**
   - Check for file system errors, such as insufficient disk space or permission issues, when creating or writing files.
   - Ensure the download directory exists and is writable before starting the crawler.

#### c. **FTP Error Handling**
   - Add detailed error handling for FTP connections, including:
     - Invalid credentials.
     - File not found on the server.
     - Connection timeouts.

#### d. **Recover from Panics**
   - Use `defer` and `recover` to handle unexpected panics in goroutines and log them instead of crashing the program.

#### e. **Retry Logic for Specific Errors**
   - Retry only for specific transient errors (e.g., timeouts, connection refused) and skip permanent errors (e.g., `404 Not Found`, `403 Forbidden`).

---

### **2. Efficient Link Caching**
#### a. **In-Memory Link Cache**
   - Use a `sync.Map` or a concurrent-safe map to cache visited links and avoid reprocessing them.

#### b. **Persistent Link Cache**
   - Save visited links to a file (e.g., `visited_urls.txt`) and load them on startup to resume crawling from where it left off.

#### c. **Bloom Filter for Link Deduplication**
   - Use a Bloom filter to efficiently check if a link has already been visited, reducing memory usage for large-scale crawls.

#### d. **Domain-Based Rate Limiting**
   - Limit the number of requests per second to a specific domain to avoid overloading servers and getting blocked.

---

### **3. Improved Concurrency**
#### a. **Worker Pool for Downloads**
   - Use a worker pool to limit the number of concurrent downloads and avoid overwhelming the system or the server.

#### b. **Dynamic Concurrency Control**
   - Adjust the number of concurrent workers based on system resources (e.g., CPU, memory) and network conditions.

#### c. **Graceful Shutdown**
   - Implement a graceful shutdown mechanism to handle interruptions (e.g., `Ctrl+C`) and save the current state (e.g., visited links, pending downloads).

---

### **4. Enhanced URL Handling**
#### a. **URL Normalization**
   - Normalize URLs to handle variations (e.g., trailing slashes, query parameters) and avoid duplicate processing.

#### b. **Relative URL Resolution**
   - Improve handling of relative URLs by ensuring they are resolved correctly against the base URL.

#### c. **URL Filtering**
   - Add filters to exclude specific URL patterns (e.g., `logout`, `admin`) or file types (e.g., images, videos).

---

### **5. Logging and Monitoring**
#### a. **Structured Logging**
   - Use a structured logging library (e.g., `logrus` or `zap`) to log events in a machine-readable format (e.g., JSON).

#### b. **Progress Reporting**
   - Display real-time progress (e.g., number of URLs visited, PDFs downloaded) in the terminal.

#### c. **Error Reporting**
   - Log detailed error information, including stack traces, for easier debugging.

#### d. **Metrics Collection**
   - Collect and log metrics (e.g., download speed, error rate) to monitor the crawler’s performance.

---

### **6. Configuration Management**
#### a. **Command-Line Arguments**
   - Add support for command-line arguments to configure:
     - Starting URL.
     - Download directory.
     - Network interface.
     - Concurrency level.
     - Retry settings.

#### b. **Configuration File**
   - Use a configuration file (e.g., `config.yaml` or `config.json`) to store settings and avoid hardcoding values.

#### c. **Environment Variables**
   - Allow configuration via environment variables for easier deployment in containerized environments.

---

### **7. Advanced Crawling Features**
#### a. **Depth-Limited Crawling**
   - Limit the depth of crawling to avoid exploring too many links and getting stuck in large websites.

#### b. **Robots.txt Compliance**
   - Respect the `robots.txt` file to avoid crawling disallowed pages.

#### c. **Sitemap Parsing**
   - Parse `sitemap.xml` files to discover URLs more efficiently.

#### d. **JavaScript Rendering**
   - Use a headless browser (e.g., Chrome via `chromedp`) to crawl JavaScript-heavy websites.

---

### **8. Performance Optimization**
#### a. **Connection Pooling**
   - Use a connection pool for HTTP requests to reuse connections and reduce overhead.

#### b. **Compression Support**
   - Enable HTTP compression (e.g., `gzip`) to reduce download sizes and improve speed.

#### c. **Batch Processing**
   - Process URLs in batches to reduce the number of I/O operations and improve efficiency.

---

### **9. Security Enhancements**
#### a. **TLS Configuration**
   - Use a custom TLS configuration with secure cipher suites and certificate pinning.

#### b. **Input Validation**
   - Validate user inputs (e.g., URLs, directory paths) to prevent security vulnerabilities (e.g., path traversal).

#### c. **Rate Limiting**
   - Implement rate limiting to avoid being flagged as a bot or getting blocked by servers.

---

### **10. Testing and Debugging**
#### a. **Unit Tests**
   - Write unit tests for critical functions (e.g., URL sanitization, error handling).

#### b. **Integration Tests**
   - Test the crawler against real websites to ensure it handles edge cases (e.g., redirects, malformed URLs).

#### c. **Debug Mode**
   - Add a debug mode to log detailed information for troubleshooting.

---

### **11. Documentation**
#### a. **Code Comments**
   - Add comments to explain complex logic and improve code readability.

#### b. **User Guide**
   - Write a user guide with instructions for running the program and interpreting logs.

#### c. **API Documentation**
   - If the code is part of a larger project, document the API for other developers.

---

### **12. Deployment and Maintenance**
#### a. **Docker Support**
   - Create a Dockerfile to containerize the application for easy deployment.

#### b. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Set up a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) to automate testing and deployment.

#### c. **Monitoring and Alerts**
   - Integrate with monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to track the crawler’s health and performance.

---

### **Example Implementation of Some Features**

#### **1. In-Memory Link Cache**
```go
var visitedURLs sync.Map

func hasVisited(url string) bool {
	_, loaded := visitedURLs.LoadOrStore(url, true)
	return loaded
}
```

#### **2. Worker Pool for Downloads**
```go
const numWorkers = 10

func startWorkerPool(dir string, urls <-chan string) {
	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	for i := 0; i < numWorkers; i++ {
		wg.Add(1)
		go func() {
			defer wg.Done()
			for url := range urls {
				err := downloadFileWithRetry(url, dir, maxRetries, initialDelay)
				if err != nil {
					log.Printf("Error downloading file: %s", err)
				}
			}
		}()
	}
	wg.Wait()
}
```

#### **3. Command-Line Arguments**
```go
import "flag"

func main() {
	var startingURL, dir string
	flag.StringVar(&startingURL, "url", "", "Starting URL to crawl")
	flag.StringVar(&dir, "dir", "", "Directory to store downloaded PDFs")
	flag.Parse()

	if startingURL == "" || dir == "" {
		log.Fatal("Please provide a starting URL and download directory")
	}

	// Rest of the code...
}
```
