This Go program is designed to scan a specified directory for duplicate files based on their MD5 hash values. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

Constants and Imports: It imports necessary packages and defines a constant bufferSize to specify the size of the buffer for reading files, set to 1MB.

hashFileMD5 Function: This function takes a file path, opens the file, and calculates its MD5 hash. It reads the file in chunks (determined by bufferSize) to handle large files efficiently.

scanDirectory Function: This function scans a directory for files and groups them based on their size first, and then calculates their MD5 hashes. It uses goroutines and a buffered channel for concurrent processing of files, improving performance for large directories. A mutex is used to ensure thread-safe access to shared maps (fileHashes and fileSizes).

Worker Goroutines: Creates a fixed number of worker goroutines that process file paths sent to the tasks channel. Each worker calculates the MD5 hash of the file and updates the fileHashes map.
Walking the Directory: The filepath.Walk function is used to traverse the directory. It adds file paths to the fileSizes map, grouping files by size.
Dispatching Tasks: A separate goroutine is used to send file paths from fileSizes to tasks. Only files with duplicate sizes are sent for hash calculation to optimize performance.
main Function: This is the entry point of the program.

It prompts the user to enter a target directory and checks if it exists.
It asks if the user wants to recursively scan directories, though the program currently only supports recursive scanning.
Calls scanDirectory to process the target directory.
Results (duplicate files based on MD5 hash) are written to an output file named using the target directory and the current timestamp.
Error Handling: The program includes error handling at various stages, such as file opening, directory walking, and output file creation.

Logging: Uses logging to provide information about the program's progress and any errors encountered.

In summary, this program is a utility for finding duplicate files in a directory by comparing their MD5 hashes. It's designed for efficiency with concurrent processing and is capable of handling large directories and files.
