Sure! Let's go through the Go program step by step to understand how it works:

1. The program starts by defining the main package in Go, which is necessary to create an executable program.

2. It imports required packages: "bufio" for reading the link text document line by line, "fmt" for basic input/output operations, "io" for file input/output, "net/http" for HTTP requests, and "os" for file system operations.

3. In the main function, the program prompts the user to enter the path to the text document containing the links by using the `fmt.Scanln()` function to read user input from the console.

4. The program defines a target directory named "downloads," where the downloaded files will be saved.

5. It creates the "downloads" directory if it doesn't already exist using the `os.MkdirAll()` function. The `0755` permission ensures that the directory is readable, writable, and executable by the owner, and readable and executable by others.

6. The program opens the link file for reading using `os.Open()` and stores the file descriptor in the `file` variable. If there's an error opening the file, it displays an error message and exits the program.

7. It uses the `defer` statement to ensure that the file is closed after the function exits, even if there is an error.

8. The program creates a `bufio.Scanner` to read the link text file line by line.

9. For each line in the link file, the program trims any leading or trailing whitespaces using `strings.TrimSpace()`. If the line is empty, it continues to the next line.

10. The `getFileName()` function is called to extract the filename from the URL. The function uses `strings.Split()` to split the URL based on '/' and returns the last element (file name).

11. The `getFileName()` function is a helper function to extract the file name from the URL.

12. The program appends ".pdf" to the file name to ensure that the downloaded files are saved with the '.pdf' file extension regardless of the original file type.

13. The program creates the `filePath` by joining the target directory and the file name with ".pdf" extension using `filepath.Join()`.

14. The program calls the `downloadFile()` function to download the file from the given URL and save it with the specified file path.

15. If there is an error during file download, the program displays an error message and continues to the next line.

16. If the file is downloaded successfully, the program displays a message confirming the download and the saved file path.

17. The program checks for any error that may have occurred during the scanning process using `scanner.Err()`.

18. If there is an error, it displays an error message.

19. The program finishes execution.

In summary, the Go program prompts the user to enter the path to a text document containing URLs of files to be downloaded. It then reads the URLs, downloads the corresponding files, and saves them with the '.pdf' file extension in the "downloads" directory.
